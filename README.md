# EDUCATIONAL-DATABASE-MANAGEMENT

  Creating a well design structure and relational data model that efficiently manages the students and teachers’ details. it is also designed to support various educational sector, which will help them track students’ details including teachers’ management, and project oversight, while enabling robust data retrieval and reporting functionalities.

  The project involves a sequential approach of analyzing the educational sector database design and implementing the design of different students.

1.	**Student-Age Retrieval**:  fetches students that have the same age, producing valuable details for students from their age status for standardization. Retrieves the second-youngest student with the teacher and the class for easy identification.

2.	 **Teacher-Student Retrieval**: Provides a count of students managed by each teacher, sorted by the number of teachers, which helps in proper accountabity and managing of the students in each class.

3.	**Student Data Formatting**: Retrieve and formats students’ names and their age to streamline reporting, making it easier in identifying the students with their age and for clarity

4.	**Row-Based Data Retrieval**: Selecting only odd-numbered rows, demonstrating data filtering capabilities which could be useful for sampling or segmented reporting

5.	**Create view for the table**: the view implementation is use to extract the students of a certain age for clarification which is use for educational sector.

6.	**Stored Procedure Implementation**: Procedures were developed to automate teachers, state, and class of a certain student, including updating student class, teachers and state details or records with error handling.

**Project Impact of business**

  	**Enhanced Data Organization**: The well-structured database facilitates efficient data management, minimizes unnecessary repetition or duplication of data within a system, and It ensures that the data remains correct and unaltered during storage, retrieval, and processing.

  	**Maximize Inventory management**: The database design gives room for efficient tracking and management of student’s class by tracking the teacher responsible for the student’s knowledge impact.

  	**Enhanced Clarity**: The database structure facilitates tracking of student data and teacher data for ensuring greater transparency and accountability in educational sector.

  	**Decision-Making improvement**: Advanced queries offer valuable insights into students understanding together with their age and the class they are, and teachers’ progress on the students which helps in supporting strategic decision-making.
  
  	**Streamlined Processes**: Stored procedures streamline routine tasks like updating students’ progress in learning and generating reports, enhancing operational efficiency and minimizing database errors.

  **The Tools Used for this Analysis:**

  SQL, Data Insertion, Stord Procedure, Views, EError Handling, Analytical Reporting.
